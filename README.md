# incrementing-number-with-string
Wanted to see if I could write out a string multiple times, with a number next to it counting each increment
----------------------
#Was writing a detailed new years resolution(I know, this should be done before the actual new years), When i strumbled upon an issue. In my Google Docs document, I wanted to keep track of each week in 2023 and put a checkbox next to it to mark off if I hit the goal for the select weeek. I was manually writing "Week 1:", "Week 2:",
"Week 3:", etc. When it occured to me, that I definitely could find an easier way to do this. Instead of writing the same string 52 times, I decided that I probably could write a loop in JavaScript to do this for me.
